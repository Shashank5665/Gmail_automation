# Code Modularity:
The current codebase demonstrates a modular approach with separate modules (mailer.js, gmailApi.js, autoReply.js). However, to enhance maintainability additional efforts can be made for better code modularity. Refactoring these modules to have clear and focused roles will contribute to improved code quality, ease of maintenance.

# Error Handling:
The existing error handling in the code is minimal, with error messages being logged to the console without detailed information. There is a need for comprehensive error handling. This includes incorporating meaningful error messages where applicable, providing user-friendly feedback.


# Security:
The existing implementation may lack some essential security measures, particularly in operations involving sensitive data, such as sending emails and interacting with external APIs. To include thorough input validation, secure storage of credentials, and proper handling of user data.

# Performance:
The current implementation is fine, but I still think there are few areas, which can be improved, like
putting additional checks to avoid unnecessary API calls, and using caching to improve performance.
